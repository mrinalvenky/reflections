Need to do git init to initialize a repository. 
After the init there is nothing commited in the repository and all files are marked as untracked. 
Used git status to see the current status of the files which shows all are untracked. git log gives an error.

3 spaces, the working directory, staging area and git. When you add it goes to staging area, when you commit
it goes to git.
git add to move to staging area and git commit to move to git

Its good to have branches when you are working on experimental features.

Each git commit stores its parent commit so if we have multiple branches the git log starts with latest commit on that branch
and goes back till it finds a commit that has no parent.
branches which have no labels cannot be accessed

To create and checkout a branch a single command git checkout -b <branchname> can be given
